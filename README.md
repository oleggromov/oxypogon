# Oxypogon

Oxypogon.js is a simple static website/blog assembling utility that is build over Node.js.

I decided to make a simple blog engine named Colibri years ago (maybe near 2009), but unfortunately this name on npm is already taken. So I've browsed wiki and some sites about birds and found a [beautiful and a bit grumpy hummingbird (colibri)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2196347/17130607/74000fb2-532a-11e6-9ed4-dc604296367c.jpg) which name is Oxypogon. That is, meet Oxypogon.js!

**The development is in progress, so it's not safe to use the code right now.**
